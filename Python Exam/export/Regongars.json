{"pcID": 1, "pID": 1, "name": "Regongars", "race": "Half-Orc", "str": 14, "dex": 10, "con": 16, "description": "A half-orc magus and escapee from Numeria, together with Octavia.\r\n\r\nBorn to an orc mother and non-orc father in one of the Kellid tribes of Numeria, Regongar remembers little about his past before he was sold into slavery. He does remember some details- such as having a brother who was not sold with him- and this has left him with a deep resentment for his roots. For this reason he chooses to refer to himself as an orphan and values his relationship with his lover Octavia, whom he grew up with while they were both enslaved, above all else.\r\n\r\nRather than study as a traditional wizard, Regongar uses his natural affinity for magic combined with weapon wielding in combat and is a gifted, if unpredictable, spellcaster. This made him an extremely valuable slave to the Technic League who claimed he had blue dragon's blood and continued training him in the arts of combat despite the risk of his rebellion."}
